            <h2><span> SPIDERVERSE</span> of Miles Morales </h2>
            <h3>Interdimentional Traveler</h3>

            <p>Miles Morales, a young kid from Brooklyn visited his uncle Aaron Davis (which was against his parents'
                wishes,
                due to his uncle's criminal past) after being awarded the final spot in a charter school lottery. At his
                uncle's
                apartment Miles was bitten by the Oz-enhanced spider, which emerged from Aaron's bag, and Miles
                discovered
                he
                received superhuman abilities like camouflage, increased agility, as well as some sort of stun blast,
                and
                upon
                revealing his newly found powers to his best friend, Ganke Lee, both concluded he had power similar to
                Spider-Man's, including wall-crawling. But Miles reacted negatively, as he just wanted to be normal, and
                decided
                to leave heroism to the actual Spider-Man.</p>

            <h2>The PRIME Universe</h2>
            <h3>Multiversal Adventures</h3>
            <p>With the emergence of an Inhuman named Ulysses Cain who possessed the ability to profile the future,
                Miles sided with the stand of his mentor in the Avengers, Iron Man, that using Ulysses' visions to
                prevent incidents before they happened could be catastrophic, which opposed Captain Marvel's view on the
                matter.[89] After an attempt at acting on one of Ulysses' visions resulted in the death of Bruce Banner,
                Miles' views were consolidated. Miles, Nova and Ms. Marvel actively supported Iron Man's side, and
                subsequently assisted him in assaulting the Triskelion to confront Captain Marvel.[</p>
