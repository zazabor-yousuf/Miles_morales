            <h2><span> SPIDERVERSE</span> of Miles Morales </h2>
            <h3>Interdimentional Traveler</h3>

            <p>Miles Morales, a young kid from Brooklyn visited his uncle Aaron Davis (which was against his parents'
                wishes,
                due to his uncle's criminal past) after being awarded the final spot in a charter school lottery. At his
                uncle's
                apartment Miles was bitten by the Oz-enhanced spider, which emerged from Aaron's bag, and Miles
                discovered
                he
                received superhuman abilities like camouflage, increased agility, as well as some sort of stun blast,
                and
                upon
                revealing his newly found powers to his best friend, Ganke Lee, both concluded he had power similar to
                Spider-Man's, including wall-crawling. But Miles reacted negatively, as he just wanted to be normal, and
                decided
                to leave heroism to the actual Spider-Man.</p>

            <h3>Multiversal Adventures</h3>
            <p>With the emergence of an Inhuman named Ulysses Cain who possessed the ability to profile the future,
                Miles sided with the stand of his mentor in the Avengers, Iron Man, that using Ulysses' visions to
                prevent incidents before they happened could be catastrophic, which opposed Captain Marvel's view on the
                matter.[89] After an attempt at acting on one of Ulysses' visions resulted in the death of Bruce Banner,
                Miles' views were consolidated. Miles, Nova and Ms. Marvel actively supported Iron Man's side, and
                subsequently assisted him in assaulting the Triskelion to confront Captain Marvel.[</p>

                <p>In an unusual turn of events, Miles accidentally encountered the Spider-Man of an alternate universe.
                    Because Peter Parker was dead in his world and there was confusion between the two, they began to
                    fight.Peter unmasked Miles and demanded answers. However, Miles managed to knock out Peter using his
                    venom strike. Unsure what to do with him, Miles brought Peter to S.H.I.E.L.D. to sort things out. At
                    the
                    Triskelion, Fury learned that this Peter Parker was from another world entirely. Suspecting there
                    might
                    be trouble in a dimensional incursion, he wanted to have Miles fill Peter in on what happened to
                    that
                    world's Peter Parker.</p>

                <p>Captain Universe is not one person. In one sense, it is not a person at all--it is the Uni-Power (an
                    aspect of the Enigma Force) and a manifestation of the Universe itself, a sentient symbiotic energy
                    field that seeks out people in great peril and bonds with them. In another sense, it is every
                    person--it
                    is the potential for heroism that lives in each of us. When the Uni-Power chooses a partner, it
                    endows
                    that person (or, rarely, persons) with the powers, memories, and costume of Captain Universe. The
                    partner can use the powers of Captain Universe until the peril is surmounted. However, if the
                    partner
                    tries to use those powers for personal gain or for evil, the Uni-Power immediately deserts him or
